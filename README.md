# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-SVM-
This project implements a Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. The goal is to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical attributes using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

📌 Project Highlights

Used Pandas & NumPy for data handling and preprocessing

Applied StandardScaler for feature standardization

Implemented SVM with Linear Kernel for classification

Performed Train-Test Split (80:20) with stratified sampling

Achieved:

Training Accuracy: ~78.6%

Testing Accuracy: ~77.2%

Built a real-time prediction system for new user inputs
